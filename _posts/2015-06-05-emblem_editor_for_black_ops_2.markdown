There are a few rules that are used when creating emblems in Black Ops 2:

1. Each emblem has 32 layers
2. Each layer can be either empty or contain an image
3. The following actions can be performed on an image:
    1. Translate
    2. Scale (uniformally)
    3. Horizontal or vertical stretch
    4. Flip over it's y-axis (i.e. rotate by 180 degrees over the y-axis)
    5. Set color to an RGBA value
    6. Copy to another layer (and possibly overwrite it's layer's image)
    7. Rearrange (e.g. the image in the first layer can be moved to be in the second layer)
