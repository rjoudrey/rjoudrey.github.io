## Description

The *Ultimate Utility for Ghosts* app provides a reference guide for the game *Call of Duty Ghosts*.

I was primarily tasked with building the custom *Select Item* that's used throughout the app for making selections in categorized data, as well as architecting the *Create a Class* feature.

The *Create a Class* feature emulates the functionality of the one found in *Call of Duty Ghosts*. It was architected in such a way that adapting it to future titles would require only minor UI changes and modification of a text file that defines rules for how different items interact with each other.
